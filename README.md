# hepitrack

Hepitrack is a health tracking application, the user can track their water intake, food consumption and symptoms that they are having. The data is persisted in an sqlite file as well as on the server with the [hepitrack_flask](https://github.com/dbilgin/hepitrack_flask). This way if the user logs in to their account they can retrieve their tracking data easily.

Apart from some nice UI tricks with Flutter's animation capabilities, it includes randomized health-related news from http://newsapi.org/.
Hepitrack helps the user to track their habits and find out problems that might be caused due to things that they are not aware they are doing.

Currently hepitrack is only available on Android, if you would like to check it out, you can download it here:
